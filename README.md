# Hello, team!

Welcome to the `microsoftPage` project — a *practice project* for WD#043 to create a static copycat of some well known official website!
\
\

If you're a curious passerby, the compiled web page can be visited any time at: https://priyankapasrija.github.io/microsoftPage/

For the team, here's a little cheat sheet of Git commands you should remember:

- **git init** — Initialize a Git repository in current directory.
- **git status** — Check the status of files in current branch.
- **git add \<file/s> | .** — Add new files/changes to stage.
- **git commit -m "\<msg>"** — Commit the changes with an additional message.
- **git merge \<main branch>** — Merge branch with master/main.
- **git branch | \<name>** — List all branches, green text branch is current working branch or make new branch but don't jump to it.
- **git branch -M \<new name>** — Change name of current branch.
- **git remote add origin "\<url>"** — Link local repo with a remote repo.
- **git checkout -b "\<new branch name>"** — Add new branch and jump onto it.
- **git checkout \<existing branch name>** — Jump to another branch.
